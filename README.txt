In our program for the three different generators we have explored the different
ways to not only implement the generators, but also how they are affected by 
different inputs and what kind of outputs we can expect from the differing 
inputs. We only have the beginings of a plan for the "stat" mode that will be 
used. We have not done any running of the Dieharder utility yet, as that 
appears to be reserved for part 2, however we do expect that our output will be
properly formatted for the Dieharder utility.
